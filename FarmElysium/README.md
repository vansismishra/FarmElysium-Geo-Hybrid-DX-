Crop Yield Prediction Project is a comprehensive research initiative aimed at predicting crop yields in four prominent Indian states: Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques, coupled with a unique hybrid algorithm, to forecast crop production based on various factors such as soil types, rainfall patterns, and historical data.

Key Features

Data Collection:

Gathered extensive datasets covering crop production, soil types, and rainfall patterns from 2012 to 2014.
Focused on five major crops: Rice, Urad, Wheat, Sugarcane, and Maize.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Implemented rigorous data cleaning processes to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Applied advanced preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure uniformity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to unveil hidden patterns and relationships.
Utilized visualizations to depict key trends, correlations, and anomalies.

Algorithmic Approach:

Employed three machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Utilized deep learning with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models.
Developed a novel Hybrid Algorithm, integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM for enhanced predictions.

Evaluation Metrics:

Utilized robust evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R^2 to assess algorithmic performance.

Visualization and Comparative Analysis:

Implemented captivating visualizations to portray algorithmic predictions.
Conducted a comparative analysis to determine the most effective algorithm for crop yield prediction.
